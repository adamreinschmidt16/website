I have been playing the cello for over 10 years; in addition, I have played piano for 11 years and sung in upper-level high school and collegiate choirs for nearly 3 years. I attended Roseville Area High School in Minnesota, where I played in our school's top Symphony Orchestra, as well as the Chamber Orchestra and multiple smaller ensembles. Over 3 years, I was among the top 3 seated cellists every time, and during my senior year served as the Principle Cellist and section leader. During this time, I had the opportunity to perform 2 featured solos: the first movement of Antonin Dvorak's Serenade for Strings in E Major, Op. 22, and an arrangement of Ralph Vaughan Williams' Fantasia on Greensleaves for Solo Cello, Flute, Harp and Chamber Orchestra."

I still remain very active in the college music program, however; I sing bass/baritone in the New College Chorus, and I helped found the New College Chamber Music Group, where I play both piano and cello. Outside of music performence and academics, I'm a voracious music, film and video game nerd; I love to read books and magezines, especially Smithsonian and works by Cormac McCarthy, John Steinbeck, John Muir, and Michael Crichton. I love camping, hiking, canoeing, and anything else that gets met into the wilderness."
